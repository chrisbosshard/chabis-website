        question: "How much does Chabis cost?",
        answer:
          "Chabis is basically free. To start, we give you 5 free premium recipes (including AI images and detailed nutritional values) and then 2 more every week. If you want more, you can upgrade to Chabis Premium for unlimited generation and the smartest AI mode. The standard recipe function remains free forever.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does Chabis work offline?",
        answer:
          "Yes and no. Since our AI calculates recipes live for you, you need an internet connection for generation. But: All recipes you've saved in your cookbook are also available offline, so you can cook without problems in the supermarket or in areas with no signal.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which diets are supported?",
        answer:
          "Almost all. Chabis understands complex dietary forms like Vegan, Vegetarian, Pescatarian, Keto, Low Carb, and Paleo. The special thing: The AI automatically combines this with your allergies (e.g., Gluten, Lactose, Nuts) and personal dislikes (e.g., 'No cilantro').",
      },
      {
        question: "Is my data secure?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely. As a Swiss app, data protection is our top priority. Your health data, allergies, and preferences are securely encrypted and never sold to advertising partners. We use this data exclusively to perfectly tailor recipes to you.",
      },
      {
        question: "On which devices does Chabis work?",
        answer:
          "Chabis is currently exclusively optimized for iPhone (iOS) and available in the Apple App Store. We focus on providing the best experience for iOS before expanding to other platforms.",
